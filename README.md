# Utility Addition to xv6
In this project we added various utilities to the [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public) operation system. We have added various utilities such as new system calls, message passing algorithms, distributed algorithms for parallel computation.      

## Requirements
1. A Linux based operating system 
2. [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/)
3. xv6
   

The code can be found inside the xv6_assig1 directory.    
### Steps to start with xv6
1. make qemu (for Linux based system) / make qemu-nox (for WSL)
2. You can take a look at all the programs stored and run any program by simply calling it's name
3. For exiting: Ctrl+Alt+q (if make qemu was used) / Ctrl-a x (if make qemu-nox was used)     
         
The detailed report can be found [here](Report.pdf) and the overview of the theory of various utilties added to xv6 can be found [here](Overview.odp).
